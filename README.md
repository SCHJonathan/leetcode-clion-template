# LeetCode Clion Template

This is the repo I store my Clion template for LeetCode. I generally feel pretty comfortable with LeetCode built-in 
webpage IDE. I use Clion to ease my pain only when either the problem needs to write way too many codes or debugging my 
buggy code is painful on web IDE.

I used the logging library [pprint](https://github.com/p-ranav/pprint) with some minor tweaks for personal preference. 
Admittedly, this is a really convenient library and when you look at the source code of the 
[pprint](https://github.com/p-ranav/pprint), you will discovery a bunch of hard-coded type conversion. I feel I can 
probably do better than that by better template design. (Researching it is on my todo list). Doing a reflection on C++ 
still seems overly painful compared to `Golang`.

Hope this template might pave the path for your LeetCode journey. If you find any room of improvement, feel free to make
a pull request.
